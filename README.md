NOTE: "Do Not upgrade the project", as it will introduce issues related to the version and others.Specifically,after clone of this Git repository,just run the code "Mainactivity file" in the emulator,without the upgrade of project.

In this project,I have created a Weather Application. The live weather data is obtained from the openWeather API, and I have already included this API in the code. The weather is displayed in both Celsius and Fahrenheit degree, and rounded to an integer value. Moreover, we also provide details on windspeed and humidity. 

Steps:
1. After clone of this Git repository, run the code "Main activity file" in the emulator.
2. Add the City name in the search bar on top, and click to search option with the mouse button.

Reference:
While working on this project, I faced several errors and issues, and I took help from Google search and related Youtube videos to resolve these errors. As an example, hints on how to round the digit and how to use Math operations to convert Celsius into Fahrenheit degrees, and other similar errors and issues were resolved by using Youtube videos and Google search options.
